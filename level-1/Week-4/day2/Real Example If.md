# Real Example: Droid Access Control

In the Star Wars universe, security protocols vary significantly. This example pseudocode simulates a security check for a droid accessing a restricted area of a spaceship:

```plaintext
IF droidID == "R2D2" THEN
    DISPLAY "Access granted, welcome aboard!"
ELSE
    DISPLAY "Access denied. This incident will be reported."
ENDIF
