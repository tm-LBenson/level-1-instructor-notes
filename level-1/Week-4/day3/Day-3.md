## Overview

Today, we delve into loops and iterations, essential constructs in programming that allow repetitive tasks to be automated efficiently. We'll explore different types of loops and how they can be used to solve problems.

## Objectives

- Understand what loops are and why they are important in programming.
- Learn about different types of loops used in programming.
- Apply loops to solve repetitive tasks through hands-on exercises.

## What are Loops?

Loops are fundamental programming constructs that repeat a block of code multiple times until a specified condition is met. They are crucial for automating repetitive tasks and reducing code redundancy.

## Types of Loops

- **For Loops**: Executes a block of code a specific number of times.
- **While Loops**: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Do-While Loops**: Executes a block of code at least once, then repeats the loop as long as a specified condition is true.

## Detailed Explanation

Loops are powerful tools that let programmers write more efficient, readable, and shorter code when handling tasks that require repetition.

## Examples of Loops

- [[Loop-Example-1-For-Loop|Example 1: Checking Inventory]]
- [[Loop-Example-2-While-Loop|Example 2: Fueling Up]]
- [[Loop-Example-3-Do-While-Loop|Example 3: Sending a Distress Signal]]

## Practical Applications of Loops

Discuss real-world scenarios where loops can be applied:

- **Data Processing**: Automating data entry or calculations over large datasets.
- **Game Development**: Implementing game loops for continuous play.
- **Web Development**: Generating dynamic HTML elements based on data.

## Hands-On Exercise

- **Exercise**: Students will use a loop to simulate a droid performing a series of tasks repeatedly.
- **Challenge**: Enhance the droid task simulation to include conditions that must be checked before each iteration.

## Conclusion

Understanding loops enhances a programmer’s ability to automate tasks, handle large amounts of data, and write clean, effective code. Today’s session should equip you with the skills to implement various loops in your programming projects.
